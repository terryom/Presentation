## This paper 

- Use diff-in-diff variation to estimate treatment effect of removing repossession risk on mortgage default 
      - Unexpected Irish legal ruling 


- Theoretical object of interest: moral hazard effect of reduced repossession risk 
      - Important for mortgage market design  (Piskorski and Seru, 2018) 
      - Foreclosure moratoria popular during Great Depression and Recession: what do we know about the moral hazard effects? (Mayer et al, 2014)


- 0.3 pp increase in quarterly default rates for a sample of Irish mortgages 
      - 30-40% relative increase over estimated counterfactual 



## 30 seconds on the Irish Mortgage Market 

- Mostly standard contract features 

- Recourse: if house sold, any residual balance is still owed
    - Bank cannot garnish salaries or assets without very specific/rare legal order

- Interest rate types more similar to UK than US
    - Fixed rates: 1-10 years, then reset 
    - Variable rate: interest rate decided by bank policy (not necessarily market rate)
    - U.S-style ARMs: extinct today and don't feature in my sample because Irish banks funding costs far exceeded market interest rates during crisis

## 2011: The Dunne Judgment Removes Collateral Enforcement Rights

- 25th July 2011: unexpected legal ruling in Irish High Court 

- Justice Dunne: Error in repossession law  and it is void

    - Banks cannot use the law of the land to enforce collateral ...

- New law introduced on 1st December 2009 to update old legislation regarding transfer of property deeds   
    - Failed to preserve the relevant parts of the old law 
    - Repealed but did not replace it 

## The Natural Experiment 

- Key feature of the ruling: loans originated *after* the introduction of the flawed law were still covered by repossession law

- Starting July 2011, loans issued before 1st December 2009 could not be lawfully repossessed 

- How did nobody realise the new law was inadequate? 
      - Inattention: banks rushing to issue foreclosure notices to combat rising defaults (Robinson, 2018)

## Research Design 

- Difference-in-difference variation created by the Dunne judgment 

- Diff 1: Pre-Post July 2011 

- Diff 2: Loans issued pre-post 1st December 2009 


$\implies$ For loans in a narrow window around 1st December 2009, repossession risk is quasi-randomly removed unexpectedly on 25th July 2011


## Data 

- Loan-level data on Irish mortgages issued 180-days either side of the cutoff: 1st December 2009

- Quarterly panel data on default, balance, LTV, interest rate, rate type from Q3 2010- Q3 2012
    - origination information on income, age, vintage 
    
- Loans for home purchase (no equity release) 

- Treatment group: issued before 1st December 2009 

- Match loans across treatment control group on first period borrower age, location, income, interest rate, LTV-at-origination 
    - Drop unmatched observations 
    
- Roughly 8000 loans, half of which receive treatment in July 2011 

## Default rates spiked for treated loans after Judgment

## Model 


$$ P(\textup{{default}}_{ijbgrt})=\alpha+\beta^{DD}(\textup{{Treatment}}_{j}\times\textup{Post}_{t})+\mathbf{X}_{it}^{\prime}\Psi+\phi_{rt}+\tau_{bgt}+\epsilon_{ijbgrt}$$

- Adjust for potential confounders:
    - Interest rates, interest rate types, 
    - LTV and negative equity
    - Borrower region and age
    - Vintage time trends

## Permutation Inference 

- Randomly choose other cut-off dates and repeat (X1000)

\centering\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{ri_plot.pdf}

## Mechanisms 

- Liquidity or strategic default? 

- Depending on which, policy implications are different 

- Incomplete insurance markets or imperfect mortgage contracts, liquidity default means high marginal utility borrowers getting payment relief 

- Strategic default: home no longer a good investment, can't even be repossessed so stop paying (pure moral hazard)


## Mechanisms  

- For a small sample (1347) loans, I can measure borrower's liquid account balance in 6-months prior to event 
    - within same bank 
    
- 2 triple-diff regressions
      1. Terciles of liquid wealth distribution
      2. Terciles of loan-to-value distribution

## Conclusion 

- Estimated treatment effect of removing repossession risk on default: 0.3pp increase in quarterly default rate 

- Liquidity or moral hazard? Seems to be both 
    -  Effect driven by low liquid wealth borrowers 
    - Also by highest LTV borrowers
