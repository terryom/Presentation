slide 6: Whatdoeseconomictheorytellus?

- is this a measure of social costs then?
- If there are no social costs, are there marginal borrowers?
- Large social costs, only the most desperate will default
- None, anybody will default. 
- Maybe that's interesting and you could write a tiny model just to clarify. 
   - Sounds like something you could lift from public finance literature. 


Slide 29:
treatment effect function
- maybe this should be one of the first slides on HTE

- Set it up as: oh, we care about treatment effects and knowing how they 
vary will help us tease out whether this is strategic default
-- I think the strategic default: marginal v inframarginal defaulters is nice 
-- Therefore the causal forest is really cool way of estimating it. 
- Curse of dimensionality etc
- People's heads might be fried at this stage.

- Could show the distribution of ITE as ssuggested by PAtrick B. 


Other things:
- it might be worthwhile to do a tikz graph about origination, ruling, treatment, control etc
- see paul goldsmith's github page


If people start giving you hassle about the changing economy, you can push back and say: hey, 
these guys are observationally similar. Of course, that's not the probem but then you say: look at my
pre-trends


Slide 17: Estimating Equation
- not great, be more specific

Slide 19: Eventystudy
- replace with graph?


Slide 20: tricky leverage. 
- do you even understand this? Maube read Ganong and Jaeger again
- the point you are trying to get around is that the law of large numbers doesn't hold 
with two treatment units
