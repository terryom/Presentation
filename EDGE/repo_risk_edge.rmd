# Does reducing repossession risk lead to an increase in mortgage default?

## Repossession Risk and Mortgage Default

+ Moral hazard 

<!-- + Policy question: existence and magnitude -->

+ Importance of the household default cost parameter
    - Financial stability: leverage choice (Bailey et al, 2018) 
    - Ex-post debt renegotiation: HAMP in the US, similar programmes elsewhere 
    - Policy: foreclosure moratoria 
    
+ Strategic default
    - Are borrowers strategic when it comes to default? 
    - Implications for mortgage contract design 
    

## This paper 

+ Exploit *quasi-experimental variation in Irish repossession law* to test
whether repossession risk matters for mortgage default. 

+ Analyse whether *treated loans defaulted at a higher rate* after a legal ruling striking down law.

+ Analyse heterogeneous treatment effects to answer: is excess default strategic? 
    - Distressed borrower welfare enhanced? 
    - Or just strategic borrowers getting the benefit? 

## Preview of results 

- Methodology 
      - Cut-off date in a legal judgment: law does not apply to originated before cut-off
      - Two cohorts originated either side of the cut-off date 
      - Difference-in-differences research design comparing pre and post default rates 
  
- Removing repossession risk lead to an immediate increase in default rates.
      - 1-2 pp increase in cumulative default probability in one year after event.
      - ~40% increase over estimated counterfactual.
      
- Treatment effect highest for loans with 
      - lowest and negative home equity
      - previous missed payments
      


## What does economic theory tell us? 

+ Reducing the cost associated with mortgage default should increase the demand for it.
      - Home repossession large cost of default 
      - Default may not be optimal 
      
+ Social theory:
      - Mortgage default isn't a rational cost-benefit calculation
      - Driven by emotion, not ameniable to economic analysis
      - Reduced default costs should not matter
      
+ Not exactly clear from economic theory who excess defaulters are
      - Strategic default: inframarginal borrowers default 
      


## Economic evidence


+ Public finance, health: moral hazard exists 
      - Einav & Finkelstein (2018): "compelling evidence that moral hazard in health insurance exists"
      
+ Mortgage market evidence more mixed
      - Mayer et al (2014): mortgage renegotiation programme led to increased default rates in U.S.
      - Ganong & Noel (2017): **Low** moral-hazard cost because mortgage default primarily driven by affordability
      - Agarwal et al (2017): No moral hazard effect from HAMP, a well-designed intervention
      - Collins & Urban (2016): No default response to New Jersey foreclosure moratorium
      
# Research Design

## Ireland: 2011 Court Judgment

+ 2009 Land Act 
      + December 2009: Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act replaces 1964 law.

+ July 2011: Justice Dunne rules that 2009 Act **failed to preserve relevant parts of the older law**

+ After July 2011, mortgages originated before 1st December 2009 *cannot be repossessed* if borrower defaults.
       + 2 years passed before law fixed
      
## A natural experiment 

+ For loans originated around   *1st December 2009*: repossession risk quasi-randomly removed 1.5 years later in July 2011.
      + Treatment group originated before the cut-off
      + Control group after

+ Plausibly exogeneous: treatment group did not rush to get mortgages before the new law
      + Minor change to conveyancing law, routine procedure 
      + Legal ruling *not anticipated*
      
+ Difference-in-difference: use outcome of control group to estimate missing counterfactual for treatment group.

## Data

- Central Bank of Ireland Loan-Level Data

- Collected from regulated banks for stress-testing, 2010-present

- Quarterly panel data with information on 
      - *current* loan characteristics
      - *origination* borrower characteristics 
      
      
## Paper data set 

- Take loans originated 180 days before and after the cut-off date in legal ruling: 1st December 2009
      - Pre cut-off are the treatment group
        
- Q3/2010 - Q2/2012        

- Loans are matched by an estimated propensity score
      - Future treatment group status as a function of first period covariates 
      - Matching without replacement to eliminate observations without counterpart

- 80,732 observations. 7,913 loans. Half treatment, half control.

## Mortgage default 

\[
\textup{default}{}_{it}=P(90\textup{DPD}_{it}=1\,|\,90\textup{DPD}_{is}=0\textup{\,for all }s<t)
\]

+ Loan $i$ is in default at time $t$ if it has accumlated greater than 90 days worth of missed payments.

+ Standard Basel definition of loan default 

+ Less noisy than using surrogate measures such as 30 days past due etc. 

+ Loan drops out of data once in default 
      + Theoretical interest is in the *transition* to default and not the state of being in default

# Estimation and Inference 

## Estimating Equation 

\begin{equation}
\textup{{default}}_{ibfgrt}=\alpha+\beta^{DD}(\textup{{Treatment}}_{g}\times\textup{Post}_{t})+X_{it} +\phi_{r,t}+\tau_{b,f,t}+\epsilon_{ibfgrt}
\end{equation}

where:

- $treatment_i$ is an indicator for whether the loan was originated before the cut-off. 

- $Post_t$ is an indicator for whether the observation is after the ruling (July 2011).

- $\beta_{DD}$ is treatment effect of interest

- $X_{it}$ is a matrix of control variables including treatment status, interest rate, loan-to-value ratio, borrower income, borrower age

-  $\phi_{r,t}+\tau_{b,f,t}$ are region-time and interest rate type - time fixed effects 

- Identification: within-group changes between treatment and control groups over time 
      - Conditional on controls and fixed effects, treament $\beta^{DD}$ is an unbiased estimator of treatment effect
      
- Inference: errors clustered at loan level.

## Results

## Eventy study

- Interact treatment dummy with time fixed effects 

\footnotesize\centering\input{est_estud1.tex} 


## Tricky inference

- Issue: quasi-randomisation at group level 

- Two groups: originated pre and post 1st December 2009

- Errors correlated within group? Effective sample size of 2

$\implies$ Permutation inference 


## Permutation Inference 

- Permutation inference aka randomisation inference 

- Fisher (1936); Computing power has seen resurgence (Efron & Hastie, 2017)

- "Permute" the treatment vector many times and calculate your test statistic 
      - Effect of "true" treatment vector should lie in the tails 
      - Easy to calculate an exact $p$-value to test null 
      
- Intuition: if there is nothing going on, your test statistic should be similar to a vector of random treatments


## How to permute a natural experiment? 

- This natural experiment: treatment based on cut-off date 

- Idea: permute the cut-off date and perform the analysis exactly as before 
      - Extract data, match with PSM, event study regression 

- 1000 random dates; *save* treatment effects 

- Compare "true" treatment effect to the distribution of permuted ones
      - Similar to Ganong and Jaeger (2017) on Regression Kink Design 

- Estimated difference could just be a fluke due to the particular cut-off date
      - So try *many* cut-off dates

# Heterogeneous treatment effects 

## Beyond the avearage treatment effect 

- Average treatment effect is interesting

- Is the effect driven by strategic borrowers? Or distressed borrowers?

- Welfare implications of ex-post mortgage contract policies 


## Triple difference regression

- Effect mostly driven by households carrying a missed payment

- Much smaller effect for fully-peforming households

\tiny\centering\input{est_tab_arrears1.tex} 


## Causal forest 

> Uses a random forest to reduce the curse of dimensionality in a k-nearest neighbour estimation problem 

+ Intuition: I want to group treatment and control observations on different dimensions and compare the difference in treatment effects across these groups 
        - Not obvious what variables to group on and what intervals to use
        <!-- - Low income borrowers grouped together: what is the treatment effect?  -->
        <!-- - High income borrowers group together: is the treatment effect lower?  -->


        <!-- - Income one of many possible variables -->
        <!-- - Theory does not make it clear  -->
        <!-- - Where to split high v low income -->

+ You could use a kernel regression to do it but quickly run into curse of dimensionality
                <!-- + Curse of dimensionality: how to group treatment and control units together in 4,5,6,etc dimensions  -->
                
+ Causal forest model uses random forest to decide how to weight nearby observations in a kernel regression                

## Treatment effect function

\begin{equation}
Y_{i}=(Y_{i1}-Y_{i0})=\tau(X_{i0},\,Z_{i1})+\epsilon_{i}\label{eq:tau}
\end{equation}

- Loan-level treatment effect is the difference in potential outcomes 
- Model how each individuals treatment effect varies according to covarites 
- 2 matrices: $X$ and $Z$ 
- Panel data collapsed: endline Y as a function of pre-treatment covariates


## Predicted treatment effect of loan-to-value ratio

Highly leveraged borrowers have lowest opportunity cost of defaulting

## Conclusion

- Quasi-experimental evidence of moral hazard in the mortgage market 

- Between 1 and 2 pp one-year difference in default probability 

- Doesn't look like *strategic default*
      - Excess defaults made up mostly of loans in arrears 
      - Causal forest reveals lower income, higher leverage, higher interest rate associated with high treatement effect 
      - Marginal not inframarginal borrowers default after the ruling
      
- Policy implications: reducing repossession risk as a social insurance programme?
      - Of course other costs: transfers default cost from borrower to bank
      - Other GE effects: risk pricing, banking losses
